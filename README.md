# Property Scraper

This project is a Python script that scrapes property details from Airbnb listings. It extracts information such as property name, type, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and amenities for specified URLs. 

## Features

- Scrapes property details from given Airbnb URLs.
- Extracts and formats information including property name, type, bedrooms, bathrooms, and amenities.
- Handles dynamic content loading and JavaScript-rendered pages using Selenium and BeautifulSoup.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need the following Python packages:

- `chromedriver_autoinstaller`: Automatically installs the correct version of ChromeDriver.
- `selenium`: Provides tools to automate web browser interaction.
- `beautifulsoup4`: Parses HTML and XML documents.
- `requests`: Handles HTTP requests.
- `pandas` (optional): For potential data manipulation and storage.

You can install the necessary packages using `pip`. Hereâ€™s a command to install all required packages:

```bash
pip install chromedriver_autoinstaller selenium beautifulsoup4 requests pandas
```
## Usage
Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/property-scraper.git
cd property-scraper
```
Run the script:
Modify the urls list in the scrape_property_details function with the URLs of the properties you want to scrape. Then, execute the script:

```bash
python property_scraper.py
```
This will print the property details to the console.

## Limitations
- `Element Identifiers`: The script uses dynamic element identifiers which may change with updates to the Airbnb site. More stable selectors should be used to improve reliability.
- `Error Handling`: Basic error handling is implemented, but it may not cover all edge cases, such as network issues or incomplete content loading. Enhanced error reporting and handling are needed.
- `Test Coverage`: The script lacks automated tests to verify the functionality of each component. Implementing unit tests would improve robustness.
- `Scalability`: The script processes pages sequentially. Multi-threading or asynchronous techniques should be considered to handle larger datasets more efficiently.
  
## Future Improvements
- `Use Better Element Identifiers`: Implement stable and less dynamic selectors for better reliability.
- `Enhanced Error Reporting`: Add more comprehensive error handling for various edge cases.
- `Test Coverage`: Write unit tests to ensure the robustness and maintainability of the code.
- `Scalability`: Implement multi-threading or asynchronous requests to handle larger datasets efficiently.
